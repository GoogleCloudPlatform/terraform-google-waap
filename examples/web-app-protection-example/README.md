# Web App Protection Example - Managed Instance Group Backend

This usage example shows how to successfully deploy a terraform-based infrastructure contemplating the use of Cloud CDN and Cloud Armor tools. These tools are deployed with predefined rules to protect an environment of Web applications hosted in Managed Instance Groups using the Global Load Balancer.

Additionally, we include an example of an infrastructure pipeline using Jenkins to facilitate the adoption of the model in environments that already use Jenkins as a CI/CD tool for infrastructure solutions.

## This example deploys:

-   VPC Network, Subnets, Cloud Router
    
-   Firewall Rules
    
-   GCE Managed Instance Group running JuiceShop application
    
-   Global Load Balancer with Managed Instance Groups in 2 regions
    
-   Cloud CDN with some security best practices
    
-   Cloud Armor with top 10 OWASP Rules and reCAPTCHA integration

## Requirements

-   A GCP Project containing the enabled APIs listed in this document..
    
-   All the permissions outlined later on this document must be granted to the users.
    
-   Run gcloud auth application-default login before following the step by step instructions below.

## IAM Permissions

-   The user or service account deploying this example must have the following IAM roles:Editor roles/editor
    
-   reCAPTCHA Enterprise Admin: roles/recaptchaenterprise.admin
    
-   Artifact Registry Admin: roles/artifactregistry.admin

## APIs

A project with the following APIs enabled must be used to host the resources of this module:

-   Cloud Resource Manager API: cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
    
-   Compute API: compute.googleapis.com
    
-   Identity and Access Management API: iam.googleapis.com
    
-   Cloud Monitoring API: monitoring.googleapis.com
    
-   reCAPTCHA Enterprise API: recaptchaenterprise.googleapis.com
    
-   Service Networking API: servicenetworking.googleapis.com
    
-   Service Usage API: serviceusage.googleapis.com

## Setup

Here's a step by step to deploy and test this example:

Build the infrastructure

1.  Clone waap repo

    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-google-waap.git

2.  Change to web-app-protection-example directory:

    cd terraform-google-waap/examples/web-app-protection-example

3.  Change to the dev or prd directory, depending on

    cd dev

4.  Run terraform init from within this example directory.

    terraform init

5.  Change the terraform.tfvars file values, including values related to your environment.
    
Note: The "project_id" is the only variable that must be changed. Any other variable change is optional.

6.  Run terraform plan and check the prompt output.

    terraform plan

7.  Run terraform apply within this example directory.

    terraform apply

## Deploy this example using Jenkins

If you already have a Jenkins environment to run your terraform code or if you intend to use Jenkins as your infrastructure CI/CD Tool, we created a Jenkinsfile example with a pipeline suggestion for this environment. Please, refer to the Jenkins file [link do Jenkinsfile] to view the example.

**Requirements**

-   Jenkins installed and running
    
-   [Jenkins git plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git/) installed and running
    
-   [Terraform installed](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started/install-cli) in the Jenkins instance
    
**Pipeline example**

![](https://LINK_PARA_IMAGEM)

This jenkins file contains rules based on branch names considering two different behavior:

**Behavior 1:** this behavior happens when the code is pushed to a branch with the same name as an environment folder inside web-app-protection-example/environments/ (E.g., "prd", "dev"or "npd" ).

For this condition, the pipeline code will run steps related to terraform init and terraform apply. When working with multiple environments, itâ€™s really important to change the values of the variables inside the terraform.tfvars files for each environment in order to avoid conflicts.

**Behavior 2:** differently from behavior 1, this behavior happens when the branch name doesn't match an environment folder name.

For this condition, the pipeline code will run steps related to terraform init and terraform plan, generating a plan output without changing your infrastructure.
